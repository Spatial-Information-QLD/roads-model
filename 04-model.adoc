== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some of the properties are restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with global identity, that can be used in isolation and together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat Properties as sub-parts of particular classes.

This model defines some Classes and Properties and also requires certain existing Cs & Ps for reuse. All Cs & Ps in this model, both defined and reused, are listed here with an indication of where the element is defined given in the _Is Defined By_ field.

[[AddressableObject]]

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `addr:AddressableObject`
| Preferred Label | Addressable Object
| Definition | An object that is unambiguously determined by an address.

Examples of types of AddressableObjects are a building, a dwelling or a land parcel
| Is Defined By | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/roads[ANZ National Address Model]
| Sub-class Of | https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html#_class_geofeature[`geo:Feature`]
| Provenance | Derived from <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressableObject` class and its associated codelist of subtypes
| Scope note | Judgement as to what makes for a permissable AddressableObject rests with the implementer. This model's technical requirements are only that the object is a legal `geo:Feature` object, thus implementers may make Addressable Objects of almost anything.
| Expected Properties | <<hasAddress>>, http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#[`geo:hasGeometry`]
| Example 
a| [source,turtle]

[[AddressComponent]]

[cols="2,6"]

| Property | Value

| Preferred Label | Address Component
| Definition | A component that is a constituent part of an address
| Is Defined By | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/roads[ANZ National Address Model]
| Sub-class Of | http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource[`rdfs:Resource`]
| Provenance | Derived from <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressComponent` class
| Scope note | Address Components can be literals - numbers, words etc. - or complex ojects - Localities, districtes etc. If the Address Component is a complex object, a textual representation of it must be provided when a textual rendering of all of an Addresses' component are required, for example for letter printing. 

Complex objects are preferred for use over literals when the object referred to has independent identity.

Ordering of Address Components, for example for letter printing, is not fixed within this model but should be implemented with a positioning preference system utilising the Address Component's `addr:hasComponentType` values which should come from a controlled vocabulary of Address Component Type values.

A SKOS vocabulary of Address Lifecycle Stages is suplied with this ontology.

In this model, these Lifecycle Stages are defined for use with Addresses only, not also Address Components, as per ISO19160-1.

| Scope note | ISO19160-1 does not contain an `AddressRole` class but instead an `AddressPosition` class with positioning and role properties. This Standard make role a direct property of `Address` instead and provides for a positional qualifier (qualified against the position of the `AddressableObject`) instead to allow whole addresses to carry role tasking.
