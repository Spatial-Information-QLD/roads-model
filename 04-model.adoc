== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some properties are restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with global identity, that can be used in isolation and together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat Properties as sub-parts of particular classes.

This model defines only two Classes and no Properties but reuses many Classes and Properties from other models. Where it does, basic details of, a reference to that Class or Properties' definition via `rdfs:isDefinedBy`, and a scope note about using it in this model are given.

[[RoadName]]
==== Road Name

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `:RoadName`
| Preferred Label | Road Name
| Definition | The Road Name class represents structured information that allows unambiguous determination of a Road Object for the purposes of identification and location
| Is Defined By | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/roads[Road Model]
| Sub-class Of | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/cn/CompoundName[`cn:CompoundName`]
| History Note | Specialised from <<CNM>>'s Compound Name class
| Expected Properties | <<isNameFor>>, <<value>>, <<additionalType>>, <<hasPart>>, <<hasLifecycleStage>>
| Example 
a| [source,turtle]
----
# Yundah Street South
ex:road-name-1
  a :RoadName ;
  cn:isNameFor <some-external-object> ;
  sdo:hasPart
    [
      rdf:value "Yundah" ;
      sdo:additionalType rct:RoadName ;
    ] ,
    [
      rdf:value st:Street ;
      sdo:additionalType rct:RoadType ;
    ] ,
    [
      rdf:valueText "South" ;
      sdo:additionalType rct:RoadSuffix ;
    ] ;

[[RoadObject]]
==== Road Object

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `:RoadObject`
| Preferred Label | Road Object
| Definition | A geospatial object that is unambiguously identified by a Road Name.

Examples of types of RoadObjects are a sequences of cadastral parcels of type _road_.
| Is Defined By | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/roads[Road Model]
| Sub-class Of | https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html#_class_geofeature[`geo:Feature`]
| History Note | Specialised from <<GEO>>'s Feature class, as used in <<CNM>>
| Scope note | Judgement as to what makes for a permissible RoadObject rests with the implementer. This model's technical requirements are only that the object is a legal `geo:Feature` object, thus implementers may make Road Objects of almost anything.
| Expected Properties | <<hasGeometry>>, <<additionalType>>, <<theme>>, <<hasPart>>,
| Example 
a| [source,turtle]
----
# ex:parcel-aggregate-x is inferred to be a Road Object
# due to the property cn:isNameFor indicating it
# on a Road Name instance

ex:road-name-1
  a :RoadName ;
  cn:isNameFor ex:parcel-aggregate-x ;
  ...
