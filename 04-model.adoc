== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some of the properties are restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with global identity, that can be used in isolation and together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat Properties as sub-parts of particular classes.

This model defines some Classes and Properties and also requires certain existing Cs & Ps for reuse. All Cs & Ps in this model, both defined and reused, are listed here with an indication of where the element is defined given in the _Is Defined By_ field.

[[RoadObject]]
==== Road Object

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `roads:[Road Model]`
| Preferred Label | Road Object
| Definition | A geospatial object that is unambiguously identified by a Road Label.

Examples of types of RoadObjects are a sequences of cadastral parcels of type _road_.
| Is Defined By | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/roads[Road Model]
| Sub-class Of | https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html#_class_geofeature[`geo:Feature`]
| Provenance | Specialised from <<GEO>>'s Feature class, as used in <<FL>>
| Scope note | Judgement as to what makes for a permissible RoadObject rests with the implementer. This model's technical requirements are only that the object is a legal `geo:Feature` object, thus implementers may make Road Objects of almost anything.
| Expected Properties | <<hasAddress>>, http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#[`geo:hasGeometry`]
| Example 
a| [source,turtle]
----
# ex:parcel-x is inferred to be a Road Object
# due to the property roads:hasFeatureLabel indicated for it
# that in tern indicates a Road Label instance

ex:parcel-aggregate-x fl:hasFeatureLabel ex:road-label-1 .

# this object is declared to be a Road Label

[cols="2,6"]

| Property | Value

| IRI | `roads:FeatureLabelComponent`
| Preferred Label | Feature Label Component
| Definition | A component that is a constituent part of a Feature Label
| Is Defined By | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/fl[Feature Labelling Model]
| Sub-class Of | http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource[`rdfs:Resource`]
| Provenance | Derived by the Feature Labelling Model, derived in concept from <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressComponent` class
| Scope note | Feature Label Components can be literals - numbers, words etc. - or complex objects - Localities, water feature etc. If the Feature Label Component is a complex object, a textual representation of it must be provided when a textual rendering of all of an Feature Labels' components are required, for example for letter printing.

Complex objects are preferred for use over literals when the object referred to has independent identity.

Ordering of Feature Label Components, for example for letter printing, is not fixed within this model but should be implemented with a positioning preference system utilising the Feature Label Component's `fl:hasComponentType` values which should come from a controlled vocabulary of Feature Label Component Type values. This may be a template.
| Expected Properties | <<hasValue>>, <<hasValueText>>, <<hasComponentType>>

a| [source,turtle]

| Scope note | This property is to be used to represent the textual value of Address Components that are literals and also complex objects. For a literal, the same value will be present for hasValue and hasValueText, e.g. a street number of 20 or a property name of "Bonnie Doon", however for a complex object, e.g. the locality `<http://example.com/lga/1234>`, a textual representation of it must be selected. Likely a simple name for the object will do, i.e. a Locality name or a Street Locality name.
