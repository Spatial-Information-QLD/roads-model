    sdo:description """This model is for roads information in Queensland, however it is a candidate ANZ model also, and may, in the near future, be expanded with feedback form other jurisdictions and a process through the Inter Governmental Committee on Surveying & Mapping (ICSM) to ensure it covers all ANZ jurisdictions' needs.

This model is a stand-alone model for roads information, however it is also designed to work as a Component Model part of an integrative multi-model regime for Spatial Information Queensland known as a Supermodel (see https://linked.data.gov.au/def/qsi-supermodel). The QSI Supermodel aims to integrate cadastre, address, place name, roads and other information.
