|**Provenance** | This model was made for Queensland Spatial Information, a unit of the Queensland Department of Resources, to assist with their future address and roads database design. It is a sub-model of address information that just models roads and can be used in isloation but implements address modelling patterns and can be used within address model data and systems too.
