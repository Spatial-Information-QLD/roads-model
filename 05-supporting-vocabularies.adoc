== Supporting Vocabularies

This model uses many vocabularies to give specific values to classification properties for `Address`, `AddressComponent` and to qualify relationships within the model. This section lists those vocabularies and summarises their content but not their full content which is instead linked to.

Four vocabularies expected for use with this model are defined here, within the model. Others are defined elsewhere, mainly ICSM vocabularies derived from AS4189 or the G-NAF.

Those defined here are:

* <<Address Component Types>>
* <<Address Lifecycle Stage Types>>
* <<Address Role Types>>
* <<Address Status Types>>

Three of these vocabularies are derived from vocabularies (codelists) within <<ISO19160-1>> but all are extended for use here. The remaining vocabulary - Address Role Types - is derived from the various elements of <<ISO19160-1>> but not directly from one vocabulary.

Those defined as ICSM vocabularies:

* Address Types
* Address Alias Types
* Address Role Types
* Flat Types
* Geocode Types
* Level Types
* Street Suffix Types
* Street Types

NOTE: Hyperlinks to these vocabularies will be provided as soon as persistent identifiers for them are issued. Until then, the content of these vocabularies can be found within the submission to register them: https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/icsm-vocabs/pull/13/files.

=== Address Component Types

This vocabulary is an extended version of <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressComponentType` vocabulary. The original 8 concepts from the standard are included however only one of them - `postcode` - is suggested for use within this model. An additional 19 concepts are taken from address elements in the G-NAF, such as `numberFirstSuffix`. A further 4 concepts have also been added during the design of this model to cater for newly understood future ANZ addressing needs, such as `placeName` and `indigenousPlaceName`.

=== Address Lifecycle Stage Types

This vocabulary is currently as per <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressLifecycleStage` vocabulary, however it is expected that this vocabulary will be extended early in its use in Australia/NZ as it is know that jurisdictions within ANZ use other statuses

=== Address Role Types

This vocabulary is inspired by <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressPosition` and `AddressPositionType` classes and the often repeated need in ANZ to assign purposes to Addresses. All elements are original in this model.
