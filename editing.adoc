= Setting up the editing environment

As an editor of this document, first thing to do is to install the required dependencies in order to set up the editing environment.

== Required dependencies

=== asciidoctor

For details on the different ways to install asciidoctor, please see https://asciidoctor.org/#installation. Otherwise, continue reading the next few sections on how to install asciidoctor on Windows and macOS.

==== Windows

The recommended way to install asciidoctor on Windows is by installing Ruby first via the https://chocolatey.org/[chocolatey package manager]. Once chocolatey is installed, open PowerShell and type:

----
choco install ruby
----

Now that Ruby is installed, install asciidoctor with the gem package manager.

----
gem install asciidoctor
----

You should now be able to run `asciidoctor` in PowerShell.

==== macOS and Linux

The recommended way to install asciidoctor on macOS or a Linux distribution is via the https://brew.sh/[Homebrew (brew) package manager]. Once brew is installed, open a terminal and type:

----
brew install asciidoctor
----

You should now be able to run `asciidoctor` in the terminal.

== Optional dependencies

* Python version 3+

=== Working with optional dependencies

With Python installed, as you are editing, you can set it up to auto-compile asciidoc documents on change and see it rendered live in a browser.

Create a python virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

----
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

=== The editing environment

Ensure a python virtual environment is set up and activated with the dependencies installed.

Use this repository's `Makefile` to start the file watcher in the terminal.

----
make watch
----

This will transpile all *.adoc files in this repository to static web files in `dist/`.

In a separate terminal, start the hot-reloading http web server.

----
make http
----

This will watch the `dist/` directory and hot-reload the web page using websockets.

Try and edit a file ending in `.adoc` and see the web page update live at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
