== Preamble

=== Abstract

[NOTE]
This Model is under test by Queensland Government and is a candidate model for Australian & New Zealand roads information. It is currently an unofficial model that is not yet published as a standard.

This model was made for Queensland Spatial Information, a unit of the Queensland Department of Resources, to assist with their future address and roads database design. It is a sub-model of address information that just models roads and can be used in isloation but implements address modelling patterns and can be used within address model data and systems too.

=== Namespaces

This model is built on a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models which use a variety of namespaces. Prefixes for this namespaces, used throughout this document, are listed below.

=== Conformance

This model conforms to the https://w3id.org/profile/ontpub[OntPub Profile] which is a specification for ontology publication that mandates certain structural and metadata properties for the model as a whole and model elements. Metadata elements for the model as a whole - the ontology - are given in the <<Metadata>> section above.
